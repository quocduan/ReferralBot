# Discord Referral Bot

Welcome! This repository is for, as you have hopefully already guessed, a referral bot for Discord. Hosted individually on Heroku (though it can be locally installed), this code just connects to Discord through a bot profile you create using the Discord Developer Portal, and then waits for you to use it. It's really nothing special.

## Setup

Unfortunately, this bot isn't all ready to go from step one. There's more to it, although thankfully not much. This section details in steps how to set up your own instance of this single-server bot.

### 1: Bot Profile

First things first, create a Discord bot profile through the Discord Developer portal [here.](https://discord.com/developers/) Find the bot token and copy it into a text file so it can easily be found later. At this time, designate two channels of your choice in a Discord server you own (or have moderator privileges on) as logging channels. This will allow the bot to log certain events to those channels for reference later, so it's very important.

### 2: Heroku App

Next you need to add this bot to your Heroku account by pressing this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/quocduan/ReferralBot)

First it will probably ask you for an app name, which you can set to anything you want really, and then after that some config variables. This is where the token and channel ids come in. Paste them into their respective config variable boxes. Then continue. This will, if it works correctly, auto-deploy the app to your Heroku account. If you don't have one, this will prompt you to create one or log in to one.

### 3: Configure PostgreSQL Database

This step is a little bit more hands-on than the previous two, and really just sets up the database so everything can be stored in the right place. After the app has been deployed to your Heroku account, install the Heroku CLI on your computer if you haven't already, as well as the PostgreSQL program itself (get the insaller [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), look for solutions on [this page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#pg-psql) and others linked by that page if you can't figure out how to do something). Then run the command `heroku pg:psql -a [app-name]`, replacing `[app-name]` with the name of your app. The first time you run this command it will ask you to log in so it knows you have access to the app.

This will connect your local command prompt to the database the PostgreSQL addon for Heroku set up for you. From here we must create the tables that will store your data. Start with the `servers` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS servers (
id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
prefix text);
```

It should give you a confirmation line in the command prompt.

#### Quick Note

Given the recent addition of the `repair-database` command to the bot, you can technically stop here if you like, close the command prompt, and move on to the final step. The only reason you have to create the `servers` table manually is because the bot won't work without it and thus you can't run the command that creates the other tables. However, you may also choose to continue making the database tables manually. Your choice. If you wish to run the command, simply get it set up on a server, and using whatever prefix you set, or the default `$`, run the `repair-database` command in the server you added it to. It won't confirm anything, but if you check your database info screen from your Heroku dashboard you should see three additional tables added.

If you want to continue doing this manually, you can move on to the `scores` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS scores (
user_id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
score bigint);
```

Again you should get a confirmation line, and you can move on to the `user_link` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_link (
source bigint PRIMARY KEY,
target bigint);
```

Yet again it should confirm, and now you can move on to the final table, the `webhook_profile` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS webhook_profile (
user_id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
username text,
avatar_url text);
```

This rounds out all of the table creation needed, and you can either quit the process on the command line or just quit the entire command line program for now.

### 4: Final Checks

This is the final step before you can start using the bot, and it kinda consists of multiple actions. Not to fear though, they are relatively simple and you'll be getting the bot up and running in no time at all.

First things first, you actually have to turn on the bot. Go in to the Resources tab on your Heroku application's dashboard. There should be a single Dyno listed under "free dynos" labeled "worker". Click on the button with the pencil on it, click the toggle switch so that it's on, then click "confirm". This will start the bot process.

Now that you've turned it on, go back to the Discord Developer Portal, generate an invite link for your bot, and invite it to the server you intend to use it on. Additionally if the logging channels are on a different server make sure it's also there, or it won't be able to log errors.

After that, you're done! If you have any additional issues, please ask me. I'm looking in to finding a way to get automatic updates and will let you know if I do. There's probably some Heroku resource somewhere that I just haven't found yet.
